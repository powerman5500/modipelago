mods for the ESIE archipelago instance

FILES:

iiif-pannellum_strawberry.js: added friction: 1.0 to all individual and multiscene panoramas to prevent drifting in VR view.
  added fade of 1s to panorama tours. Maybe decrease to 0.5s?

format_strawberryfield.libraries.yml: start of efforts to add 360 video to ESIE. Adds libraries for videojs and adds the videojs pannellum plugin. Need to figure out I/O of the video and how to create new ADO category
